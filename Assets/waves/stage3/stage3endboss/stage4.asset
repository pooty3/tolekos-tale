  levelDescription: "After Sally had calmed down a bit, Toleko took the second key
    and made preparations to journey to Mount Fireblast, where the fire was hidden.
    \nAfter a long and uncomfortable flight, he finally arrived at the foot of the
    fiery volcano. The heat would normally be unbearable for humans, but with the
    help of some magic, Toleko was able to cool himself down. Still, he was sweating
    like a pig and wished nothing more than to get out of this infernal place."
