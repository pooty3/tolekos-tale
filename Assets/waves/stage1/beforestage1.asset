  levelDescription: "Toleko was returning to the tower picking mushrooms in the forest.\nMaking
    his way up the cobblestone staircase, he sensed something amiss.\nThe usual clanking
    of glass and the occasional maniacal giggles that came from Old Sylfer were replaced
    by silence.  \r\nToleko rushed up into the main laboratory, only to find his
    master missing. \r\nAnd so begins Toleko's journey."
