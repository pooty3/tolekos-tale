  levelDescription: 'After Toleko defeated Valem the Never-Awake, Valem told him
    of the locations of the 3 keys needed to reach Pyfler. It would seem that Pylfer
    is always devising new tricks to prevent Toleko from taking his master back.

    Thus,
    Toleko headed off to his next destination, the Great Lake, to confront the "God
    of the Lake".'
